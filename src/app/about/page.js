        Welcome to <b className="text-amber-600"> IMdb Clone</b> build with <b > Next Js 13</b>, a movie database and review platform
        built for movie lovers and enthusiasts. As a part of my portfolio
        project, I wanted to create a platform that would provide an all-in-one
        solution for movie-related information and connect movie lovers from all
        around the world.
        <br />
        At Imdb clone, you will find a vast collection of movie information,
        reviews, and ratings. The platform is designed with a user-friendly
        interface to make it easy for you to find the movie you are looking for,
        or explore our curated collections and recommendations to discover new
        and exciting movies and TV shows.
        <br />
        With this project, I aimed to demonstrate my front-end development
        skills, including my proficiency in technologies like Next.js and React.
        The platform is designed to be fast, responsive, and scalable, ensuring
        a smooth and seamless user experience.
        <br />
        Whether you are a casual moviegoer or a film buff, Imdb Clone has
        something for everyone. I hope that this project showcases my passion
        for web development and my commitment to delivering high-quality and
        user-friendly applications.
